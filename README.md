Nimbus Nodes
===============

Nimbus Nodes is a derivative of Animation Nodes, an addon for parametric animations in [Blender](http://blender.org).

This fork will add OSC, MIDI, OS time, and real-time audio I/O as a series of nodes, with more to come. 
This fork is for use with blender 2.8 Eevee, and the default branch reflects that.

This fork adds tools for user-controlled real-time visualisers, for use in live performance.

The latest version of Animation Nodes can be found here: https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes/releases/latest

[Here](http://animation-nodes-manual.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is the official documentation for Animation Nodes.
